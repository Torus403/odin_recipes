            <li><strong>Leaveners:</strong> Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the

            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> White sugar sweetens things up a bit.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg binds the muffin batter together and lends moisture.</li>
