        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These blueberry muffins are extra large and yummy with a sugary-cinnamon crumb topping. I usually double the
            recipe and fill the muffin cups just to the top for a wonderful, extra-generously-sized, deli-style muffin.
            Add extra blueberries if you want!</p>
