        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These chocolate chip muffins are simply delicious. You won't believe how easy and quick they are to make!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Milk:</strong> This moist chocolate chip muffin recipe starts with milk.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil:</strong> Instead of butter, this recipe calls for a neutral oil (such as vegetable oil).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg lends moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the batter
                together.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour gives the batter structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugars:</strong> You'll need white and brown sugars for this sweet recipe.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking powder:</strong> Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the batter rise.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the muffins, but it won't make
                them taste salty.</li>
            <li><strong>Chocolate chips:</strong> Of course, you'll need chocolate chips!</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the wet ingredients in one bowl and the dry ingredients in another.</li>
            <li>Make a well in the dry mixture, then pour in the wet mixture and stir.</li>
            <li>Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin. Top with sugar.</li>
